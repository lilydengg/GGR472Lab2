# GGR472Lab2
for the second lab of webmap with a map
Welcome! This map shows some University of Toronto Libraries as well its proximity to the Sidney Smith Building
I have also included the TTC lines and stations if you're a commuter.
The map can also be made 3D by pressing control and the mouse left button!
Enjoy :)
